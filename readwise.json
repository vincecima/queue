I'm talking about NFL Blitz '99, the second game in the Blitz franchise and the first one to allow four players to play at the same time. This one is technically exclusive to arcades, as \"NFL Blitz 2000\" would come home on the Dreamcast and other platforms the following year. Also, there would be one more arcade release after this one, NFL Blitz 2000, which was also bundled in a \"Gold Edition\" alongside NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC, Midway's final attempt to do an NBA Jam-like game in arcades.\n\nBlitz '99 has an astounding level of depth to it, and in the video I'll attempt to show that off a bit by running a few plays a few different ways. But really it's a mix of strategy, mindgames, and execution... not entirely unlike a fighting game. I don't much care for actual football, but NFL Blitz '99 is an extremely easy pick to end up in The Jeff Gerstmann Hall of Fame.","image_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s_Atxbbyy4A/maxresdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCIAKENAF8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGGEgRyhyMA8=&rs=AOn4CLBWlixl6-DlQwd8b8YPYWe399cIVA","content":null,"source_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_Atxbbyy4A","notes":"","parent_id":null,"reading_progress":0,"first_opened_at":null,"last_opened_at":null,"saved_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:46.668000+00:00","last_moved_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:46.668000+00:00"},{"id":"01k5xreyp50wz5epn7rtp332bq","url":"https://read.readwise.io/read/01k5xreyp50wz5epn7rtp332bq","title":"NXL and Abby Russell Make an Even More Lethal Company","author":"Nextlander","source":"Reader add from import URL","category":"video","location":"new","tags":{},"site_name":"YouTube","word_count":null,"reading_time":null,"created_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:41.007776+00:00","updated_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:45.513012+00:00","published_date":"2023-12-09","summary":"We get our lethal crew back together to buy more flashlights, more shovels, and this time we even get a teleporter!\n\nNextlander is supported by its community:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/nextlander\n\nThanks for watching.","image_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4yNfgLFGeb0/maxresdefault.jpg","content":null,"source_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yNfgLFGeb0","notes":"","parent_id":null,"reading_progress":0,"first_opened_at":null,"last_opened_at":null,"saved_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:40.421000+00:00","last_moved_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:40.421000+00:00"},{"id":"01k5xrenc018b28swyb2rypvmy","url":"https://read.readwise.io/read/01k5xrenc018b28swyb2rypvmy","title":"OneXFly Impressions: Compact & Powerful!","author":"Retro Game Corps","source":"Reader add from import URL","category":"video","location":"new","tags":{},"site_name":"YouTube","word_count":null,"reading_time":null,"created_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:31.063001+00:00","updated_at":"2025-09-24T11:41:38.538945+00:00","published_date":"2023-08-03","summary":"Today we're going to take a first look at the upcoming OneXFly, a handheld PC made by the same folks behind the OneXplayer handhelds.

And what started as talking about one game each year has slowly become more and more about looking about each year in context and cross-comparing what was going on.  I think this is more useful and interesting, but it is also undeniably more resource and time intensive to produce.

They videotape the process of asking each other questions to make a video for their YouTube channel - something to do to pass the time until they die. Likely from a heart attack, cancer, or other.

Jay wins the game because he sucks and is a stupid head. Or does Mike win the game? Cause he's an ignorant bully who consumes more alcohol than god. One of them will?

In the lead up to SuperBrawl III, Sting receives a mysterious invitation to Big Van Vader’s icy mountain lair to play an insane game. What followed was a strange vignette filled with mind games that felt more like a low-budget action movie. It really is something to witness. Also, because so many fans love it, we get to see the 2 Cold Scorpio music video! Set to his theme song, the video featured Scorpio dancing, flying through the air in the ring, and more importantly playing basketball against a group of kids and absolutely dominating them. 2 Cold Scorpio was truly ahead of his time! Plus, The Z Man takes on Chris Benoit, Maxx Payne makes his WCW debut, Paul Orndorff battles The Barbarian, and Vader and Barry Windham wrestle Sting and Dustin Rhodes in the main event!\n\n\n⦁ Deadlock Discord: https://discord.gg/E4BvR4W\n⦁ Deadlock Shop: https://shop.deadlockpw.com\n⦁ Deadlock Patreon: https://patreon.com/deadlockpw\n⦁ Deadlock Twitter: https://twitter.com/deadlockpw\n⦁ Deadlock Instagram: https://instagram.com/deadlockwrestling\n⦁ Deadlock Reddit: https://reddit.com/r/deadlockpw\n⦁ Deadlock Pro Wrestling: http://deadlockpro.com \n\n#deadlock #prowrestling","image_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iM_zukcaHzM/maxresdefault.jpg","content":null,"source_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM_zukcaHzM","notes":"","parent_id":null,"reading_progress":0,"first_opened_at":null,"last_opened_at":null,"saved_at":"2025-08-09T20:52:59.451000+00:00","last_moved_at":"2025-08-09T20:52:59.451000+00:00"},{"id":"01k289ny4dhjgh7f6s3s3vz4ee","url":"https://read.readwise.io/read/01k289ny4dhjgh7f6s3s3vz4ee","title":"WCW Monday Nitro - Billy Kidman vs Juventud Guerrera: WCW Cruiserweight Title Match | DEADLOCK Watch This #252","author":"Patreon","source":"Reader add from import URL","category":"article","location":"new","tags":{},"site_name":"Patreon","word_count":53,"reading_time":"1 min","created_at":"2025-08-09T20:52:12.497021+00:00","updated_at":"2025-08-09T20:52:17.076222+00:00","published_date":"2025-08-01","summary":"Patreon is empowering a new generation of creators.

The original game, released in 1994, had a complex and mouse-driven input system that was alienating to modern audiences. The reboot attempts to bridge the gap between the old game and modern input systems by making some concessions, such as adding a traditional first-person input setup for navigation and combat. The visual style of the game also combines old and new elements, with 3D wall textures that still have a low-resolution and pixelated look. Overall, the remake aims to present System Shock in a way that is familiar to fans while also appealing to modern players.","image_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YDQ24iAkh90/maxresdefault.jpg","content":null,"source_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDQ24iAkh90","notes":"","parent_id":null,"reading_progress":0,"first_opened_at":null,"last_opened_at":null,"saved_at":"2025-07-27T16:43:57.382000+00:00","last_moved_at":"2025-08-09T19:33:59.470000+00:00"},{"id":"01k16c9ra180f2thhx2m2cepg5","url":"https://read.readwise.io/read/01k16c9ra180f2thhx2m2cepg5","title":"Gotcha!

The original game, released in 1994, had a complex and mouse-driven input system that was alienating to modern audiences. The reboot attempts to bridge the gap between the old game and modern input systems by making some concessions, such as adding a traditional first-person input setup for navigation and combat. The visual style of the game also combines old and new elements, with 3D wall textures that still have a low-resolution and pixelated look.

With Cyberpunk at the cutting edge of fiction and Star Trek's popularity resurging thanks to The Next Generation, the beloved Captain Kirk himself dipped his feet into the world of pulp literature. The result was a series of novels called 'TekWar'. Then a TekWar comic book. Then a bunch of TekWar movies. Then a TekWar TV series. Then a TekWar video game.\n\nThe books sold well. The show broke ratings records. The game did things that had never been attempted. TekWar was everywhere! TekWar was doing everything! Outside of the game's infamous reputation, why doesn't the world remember TekWar?\n\nLINKS:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/majuular\nhttps://twitter.com/majuular\nhttps://www.instagram.com/majuular/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Majuularcade (2nd channel)\n\nMusic used in this video (with timestamps):\nhttps://pastebin.com/TB7bZ6AR\nYou can listen to the original music here:\nhttps://youtu.be/Q8nMRpkNfgo\n\n00:00 - TekIntroduction\n9:09 - TekBooks & TekComics\n32:36 - TekMovies\n1:10:25 - TekShow\n1:31:54 - TekGame\n2:04:07 - TekLegacy\n2:09:48 - TekCredits","image_url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-krIPfk2OIA/maxresdefault.jpg","content":null,"source_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-krIPfk2OIA","notes":"","parent_id":null,"reading_progress":0,"first_opened_at":"2025-07-20T22:46:08.049000+00:00","last_opened_at":"2025-07-20T22:46:08.049000+00:00","saved_at":"2025-07-20T22:45:32.563000+00:00","last_moved_at":"2025-07-20T22:46:07.986000+00:00"},{"id":"01k0n07922c5m8bc9449kn9vwc","url":"https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0n07922c5m8bc9449kn9vwc","title":"Ultima Underworld II Retrospective | Thinking Bigger, Digging Deeper","author":"Majuular","source":"Reader RSS","category":"rss","location":"later","tags":{},"site_name":"YouTube","word_count":null,"reading_time":null,"created_at":"2025-07-20T22:45:38.507682+00:00","updated_at":"2025-07-21T02:33:00.524533+00:00","published_date":"2025-06-17","summary":"Ultima Underworld 2 improves on storytelling and player choice, making exploration and dialogue more important.
