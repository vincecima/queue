I'm talking about NFL Blitz '99, the second game in the Blitz franchise and the first one to allow four players to play at the same time. This one is technically exclusive to arcades, as \"NFL Blitz 2000\" would come home on the Dreamcast and other platforms the following year. Also, there would be one more arcade release after this one, NFL Blitz 2000, which was also bundled in a \"Gold Edition\" alongside NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC, Midway's final attempt to do an NBA Jam-like game in arcades.\n\nBlitz '99 has an astounding level of depth to it, and in the video I'll attempt to show that off a bit by running a few plays a few different ways.

What followed was a strange vignette filled with mind games that felt more like a low-budget action movie. It really is something to witness. Also, because so many fans love it, we get to see the 2 Cold Scorpio music video! Set to his theme song, the video featured Scorpio dancing, flying through the air in the ring, and more importantly playing basketball against a group of kids and absolutely dominating them. 2 Cold Scorpio was truly ahead of his time! Plus, The Z Man takes on Chris Benoit, Maxx Payne makes his WCW debut, Paul Orndorff battles The Barbarian, and Vader and Barry Windham wrestle Sting and Dustin Rhodes in the main event!\n\n\n\u2981 Deadlock Discord: https://discord.gg/E4BvR4W\n\u2981 Deadlock Shop: https://shop.deadlockpw.com\n\u2981 Deadlock Patreon: https://patreon.com/deadlockpw\n\u2981 Deadlock Twitter: https://twitter.com/deadlockpw\n\u2981 Deadlock Instagram: https://instagram.com/deadlockwrestling\n\u2981 Deadlock Reddit: https://reddit.com/r/deadlockpw\n\u2981 Deadlock Pro Wrestling: http://deadlockpro.com \n\n#deadlock #prowrestling", "image_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iM_zukcaHzM/maxresdefault.jpg", "content": null, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iM_zukcaHzM", "notes": "", "parent_id": null, "reading_progress": 0, "first_opened_at": null, "last_opened_at": null, "saved_at": "2025-08-09T20:52:59.451000+00:00", "last_moved_at": "2025-08-09T20:52:59.451000+00:00"}, {"id": "01k289ny4dhjgh7f6s3s3vz4ee", "url": "https://read.readwise.io/read/01k289ny4dhjgh7f6s3s3vz4ee", "title": "WCW Monday Nitro - Billy Kidman vs Juventud Guerrera: WCW Cruiserweight Title Match | DEADLOCK Watch This #252", "author": "Patreon", "source": "Reader add from import URL", "category": "article", "location": "new", "tags": {}, "site_name": "Patreon", "word_count": 53, "reading_time": "1 min", "created_at": "2025-08-09T20:52:12.497021+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-08-09T20:52:17.076222+00:00", "published_date": 1754006400000, "summary": "Patreon is empowering a new generation of creators.

The original game, released in 1994, had a complex and mouse-driven input system that was alienating to modern audiences. The reboot attempts to bridge the gap between the old game and modern input systems by making some concessions, such as adding a traditional first-person input setup for navigation and combat. The visual style of the game also combines old and new elements, with 3D wall textures that still have a low-resolution and pixelated look.

The original game, released in 1994, had a complex and mouse-driven input system that was alienating to modern audiences. The reboot attempts to bridge the gap between the old game and modern input systems by making some concessions, such as adding a traditional first-person input setup for navigation and combat. The visual style of the game also combines old and new elements, with 3D wall textures that still have a low-resolution and pixelated look.

The Cloud approach attempts to hook the player with an honest, no-frills grind. The Chronicle approach is one of maximalism, burying that grind underneath an endless procession of systems, mechanics, and shiny new ideas. Despite being bound by blood, these two games see the world very differently... and either one of them is probably gonna put you in a headlock for many, many hours.\n\n(THIS VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR BOTH GAMES)\n\nYou can find more Majuular here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/majuular\nhttps://twitter.com/majuular\nhttps://www.instagram.com/majuular/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@Majuularcade (2nd channel)\n\nMusic used in this video (with timestamps):\nhttps://pastebin.com/p0jdnefP\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n3:22 - Level-5 & Dark Cloud Development\n7:19 - (Dark Cloud) Premise\n10:26 - (Dark Cloud) The Basics\n15:25 - (Dark Cloud) The Georama\n21:26 - (Dark Cloud) Friends & Bosses\n28:05 - (Dark Cloud) Digging Into the Story\n33:17 - (Dark Cloud) The Music\n35:13 - (Dark Cloud) Durability & Stress\n43:32 - (Dark Cloud) Embracing the Grind\n53:39 - (Dark Cloud) The Characters\n58:56 - (Dark Cloud) The Plot Dump & Endgame\n1:09:59 - (Dark Cloud) The Demon Shaft\n1:15:29 - (Dark Chronicle) Introduction & Premise\n1:20:52 - (Dark Chronicle) The Shared DNA\n1:25:28 - (Dark Chronicle) Time Travel\n1:29:10 - (Dark Chronicle) The Crafting System\n1:36:34 - (Dark Chronicle) Palm Brinks\n1:39:49 - (Dark Chronicle) The Georama\n1:45:31 - (Dark Chronicle) Getting Sidetracked\n1:53:24 - (Dark Chronicle) The Dungeons & Combat\n1:58:12 - (Dark Chronicle) The 1001 THINGS of Dark Chronicle\n2:06:07 - (Dark Chronicle) Presentation\n2:08:39 - (Dark Chronicle) The Plot\n2:16:03 - (Dark Chronicle) The Fatigue & Endgame\n2:22:17 - (Dark Chronicle) The Forgotten Adventure\n2:24:51 - (Dark Chronicle) Conclusion\n2:27:24 - The Series in Summary\n2:30:37 - Credits", "image_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b0PhhcU1fEs/maxresdefault.jpg", "content": null, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0PhhcU1fEs", "notes": "", "parent_id": null, "reading_progress": 0, "first_opened_at": "2025-07-20T22:47:47.329000+00:00", "last_opened_at": "2025-07-20T22:47:47.329000+00:00", "saved_at": "2025-07-20T22:45:23.719000+00:00", "last_moved_at": "2025-09-24T20:45:54.891000+00:00"}, {"id": "01k0n0797b7bv8v38b85b36948", "url": "https://read.readwise.io/read/01k0n0797b7bv8v38b85b36948", "title": "Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar Retrospective | Reimagining the RPG", "author": "Majuular", "source": "Reader RSS", "category": "rss", "location": "new", "tags": {}, "site_name": "YouTube", "word_count": null, "reading_time": null, "created_at": "2025-07-20T22:45:38.676598+00:00", "updated_at": "2025-09-24T20:45:52.672213+00:00", "published_date": "2024-04-20", "summary": "After the release of Ultima III: Exodus, the members of Origin Systems would pack up and move across the country to the chilly town of North Andover, Massachusetts.

The result was a series of novels called 'TekWar'. Then a TekWar comic book. Then a bunch of TekWar movies. Then a TekWar TV series. Then a TekWar video game.\n\nThe books sold well. The show broke ratings records. The game did things that had never been attempted. TekWar was everywhere! TekWar was doing everything!
